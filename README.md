# SeleniumTestNgPOMProject
Automated UI testing framework using Selenium WebDriver, Java, TestNG, and Page Object Model design pattern.

This project is a robust Selenium automation framework built using Java 21 and the latest Selenium version 4.32.0. It follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to promote modular, reusable, and maintainable test code.

The framework includes the following features:

✅ Handling of web tables and dynamic content

✅ Use of relative XPath for complex and dynamic web elements

✅ Cross-browser testing using TestNG annotations (supports Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

✅ Listeners to track failed test cases

✅ Screenshots captured automatically on test failures

✅ Logging implemented via Log4j

✅ Rich reporting using Extent Reports

✅ CI/CD integration with Jenkins — the entire test suite is integrated with a Jenkins pipeline to enable automated builds and test executions

✅ Demonstrates CRUD operations in the OrangeHRM application, including:

Delete user

This framework is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and integration-ready for enterprise-level automation and continuous testing workflows.
